<h2>Thinking bout stuff....and Junk</h2>
<p> I have never quite known or understood what my thinking style was or is. In fact I never even thought to research it until now. And since getting into web development I know that it is important to know and understand what your thinking style is because thinking is part of the job, you don't know how you think, you can't do your job.</p>

<h2>My thinking style: Before the research</h2>
<p>Again I am not sure what my thinking style is, though I'm sure it's all over the place. You should see my desk, I have a stack of ruby books a bunch of art, two laptops, a Cintiq, paintbrushes, deoderant, mouthwash, erasers......I need to clean off my desk......

Anyway if I had to make a guess at my thinking style it is all over the place, I get my best coding inspiration when I draw, I get my best drawing inspiration when I code. I get my best ideas with everything else either out and about or even on the toilet. I have woken up in the middle of the night to an awesome idea that I have had. I've gone from wanting to be a chef, to a designer, to a developer and back again. My thinking process I think, is all over the place, and I don't even know if there is a name for it. But I get bored when there isn't alot to do. </p>


<h2>My thinking style: After the research</h2>
    <p>The consensus is in, and I am an Abstract Random Thinker, which makes sense, because I am not just a developer, I am also an artist. Abstract random thinkers are for the most part free spirited, creative types, and there are LOTS of places. Did you know that from what wrote up above that that was going to be the answer? I figured it would be but I wasn't sure. </p>



    <h2>My Mind is set on Growth</h2>
    <p>My mindset is a Growth mindset, I am always looking to learn and always looking to grow. I want to learn what I can and how much I can until my head explodes. My experience with DBC so far has made me want this more. There is a lot to learn bout coding and I intend to learn as much as I can until my eyes bleed and fall out of my sockets.</p>
