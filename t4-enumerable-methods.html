<h2>Ruby Methods and Enumerables!!</h2>
<p>The terms public, private and protected, apply to classes in other progamming languages such as java, and object c. HOWEVER in ruby they are a horse of a different color, they pretain to methods though their use is still the same, they are used to declare visability. We will be going over what they do, and how to use them. All three of them. so settle in so we can get this thing started.</p>

<h2>Private Methods</h2>
<p>A private method cannot be called with an explicit receiver. In other words by making a method private, you can only make it so it can call on itself to give itself directions. It cannot recieve any directions outside of the class.</p>

<h2>Protected Methods</h2>
    <p>A protected method is sort of like a private method, only not as locked up. You can call a protected method on an object as long as the default object is an instance of the same class.</p>



    <h2>Public Methods</h2>
    <p>A public method is set by default, if you do not declare that a method is either public or protected this is whatcha get. They are really common in the scope of ruby programming and most of the messages that you send to objects are called public methods.</p>




    <h2>Enumerables!</h2>
    <p>And now we come to the last, but not least bullet point for this blog, enumerables. Now bare with me here this is going to get complicated. Enumerables provide a set of methods to traverse, search, sort and manipulate collections. It's kinda like a loop. </p>
