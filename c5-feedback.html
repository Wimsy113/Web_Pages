<h2>FEEDBACK</h2>
<p>Ahh feedback, nothing like sitting down with someone, coding with them and then finding out what they thought about your pairing together. What do they say about you? What do they think about you? Did you do your best? Do you think they did their best? Is the notion of doing the feedback making you nervous because you aren't really sure how to say what you need to say?</p>

<h2>Feedback that I have gotten</h2>
<p>Overall all of the feedback that I have recieved has been critical, yet honest and kind. I think that there are things that I need to work on, and I am glad that there are people who are not afraid to sit there and let me know what my shortcomings may be. It inspires me to want to study more and improve my craft and my code. I am always looking for ways to improve and grow as a developer</p>

<h2>Feedback that I have sent</h2>
    <p>I have tried, for the most part to be encouraging without trying to make it sound like I'm kissing butt, though I know that there are times where it can come off as that. I try to be nice and critical. I am an artist so I see it and treat it as I would a critique of someones artwork. Not necessarily breaking that person down, but to make sure that they know so to speak where they maybe lacking. </p>



    <h2>Specific, Actionable and Kind</h2>

    <p>Nobody learns from being ripped apart, and no one learns from someone coddling them. Those two extremes can both be EXTREMELY detrimental to someone. Be too nice and they don't really know where they need to improve. Be mean to that person and you can discourage them, so how is it that we can give feedback and not hurt someone to the point where they don't want to do it anymore or cripple them to the point of them thinking that they are doing awesomely (which they may be) and they don't need to improve anything.And that is where being specific, actionable and kind comes into play. </p>
