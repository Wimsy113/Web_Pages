<h2>Issues! In the Tech world!Just thought you should know.......</h2>
<p>Technology has come a long way, at least since I was growing up. and as it moves along there are more jobs opening up by the day. So what are the issues facing the technology field? Well one of the biggest ones is diversity, and here are a lot of people are fighting to change that. </p>

<h2>Diversity? What?</h2>
<p>Now I know what you're thinking, "That's crazy talk! There are a ton of women in development! I know a few people who are web designers and who do tech support! in fact almost every person I talk to when I call tech support is a woman!" ummmmm well see the thing about that is in tech jobs, espeically highly paid tech jobs, women, and minorities aren't always at the top rung, in fact you would be hard pressed to find a tech company with a woman heading it up, besides Google, Yahoo, and Facebook.</p>

<h2>Okay but I'm sure there are plenty of Vets</h2>
    
    <p>Well again, no, there are a lot of things that go into trying to get a job in tech, and veterans unfortunately have so many things fighting against them to get into it. There are programs that are out there right now that can help you get on the right path as a veteran trying to get into a tech job. However that take a ton of time and a ton of money that most people who are fresh out of the military just do not have. And I know what you are going to say, "Well what about the GI Bill? They should be able to use that?" Aha, and you would be right if it weren't for the stringent rules governing use of the GI Bill, which are put into place to protect us of course, but it is kind of annoying when a proven program, has to jump through hoops to help fix a problem that people are complaining about their being.</p>



    <h2>So how do we fix it?</h2>
    <p>We fix it by making it more appealing, we fix it by making it easier for people who would otherwise not have the means to do so, can get the education needed to gain a job in technology. As it stands right now, one of the biggest sectors of tech is development and it grows more every year. It's also one of the most expense, and one of the most time consuming things to learn. Make it intersting, introduce it at a young age, and make it so veterans and others who want to participate in it do not have to give up a chunk of their life on something that they don't know is going to pan out. Don't get me wrong, there are some SOLID programs out there for this, I happen to be part of one, but not everyone has that blessing. In other words, make it more accessable, and more feesible and some of those problems will go away</p>
